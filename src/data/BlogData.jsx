    Winter in Fairfield County isn’t just cold — it’s brutal on your vehicle. Salt, sand, and chemical de-icers cling to your paint, wheels, and undercarriage. If not neutralized, they stain, corrode, and slowly break down your clear coat.

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#e1b11b] mb-4 mt-8">Why Winter Prep Matters</h3>
  
  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-300">
    Winter prep detailing is more than just a “good wash.” It’s designed to remove embedded grime and restore protection before the harsh weather hits.

      title: "Ceramic Coating vs Wax — Which Is Better?",
      date: "October 2025",
      excerpt:
        "Wax has been around for decades, but ceramic coatings changed the game. Here’s how they compare in protection, gloss, and longevity.",
      content: `
  <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
    For decades, carnauba wax was the gold standard for automotive shine. But in recent years, ceramic technology has revolutionized the detailing industry. Wax washes off in weeks — ceramic bonds at a molecular level.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#e1b11b] mb-4 mt-8">What is Ceramic Coating?</h3>
  
  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-300">
    Ceramic coating is a liquid polymer applied by hand to the vehicle's paint. It chemically bonds with the clear coat, creating years of protection instead of weeks.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#e1b11b] mb-4 mt-8">Major Benefits of Ceramic Coating</h3>
  
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3 text-gray-300">
    <li><strong class="text-white">Hydrophobic:</strong> Water beads and rolls off, taking dirt with it.</li>
    <li><strong class="text-white">UV Resistance:</strong> Prevents oxidation, fading, and sun damage.</li>
    <li><strong class="text-white">Chemical Resistance:</strong> Protects against sap, bird droppings, bugs, and acid rain.</li>
    <li><strong class="text-white">Unmatched Gloss:</strong> Creates a deep, glass-like “wet look.”</li>
  </ul>

    Wax is still useful for short-term shine or post-wash enhancement — but if you're serious about long-term protection, ceramic is on another level entirely.

    Most people assume an “interior detail” is just vacuuming and wiping. But a proper interior reset goes far deeper and restores your cabin to like-new condition.
